    <h2>6. Can't Get It Out (Cover)</h2>

    <p>
    	But, I guess that's just depression
		No sense in fighting it now

		Resurrect and start to breathe

		I thought I was a creator
		I'm here just hanging around

		I want to tell you we're alright
		Want to erase all your doubt
		I've got this thorn dug in deeply
		Sometimes I can't get it out

		I hope that we can eject soon

		Because I don't want to surrender
		Or lose your face in the crowd
		I finally found all my courage
		It was buried under the house

		Not just a manic depressive
		Toting around my own cloud
		I've got a positive message
		Sometimes I can't get it out
    </p>
